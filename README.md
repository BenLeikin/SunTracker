# SunTracker
This is how I am making my RaspberryPi based Sun tracker.

Introduction

This is my Sun Tracker project. I got bored one day and decided I wanted to learn Python and image recognition better and
I have quite a few RaspberryPis laying around so I wanted to give it a shot. 

Before I begin on my To-Do list and where my current status is on the project I will do a quick FAQ for any potential
coders or employers who may see this :).

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer or engineer by trade, I am a nerdy Linux SysAdmin. My code is not great, it didn't work for a long
time and is probably really inneficient but I did my best and it works alright.

FAQ:
Q. Aren't there more efficient ways to track the Sun?
A. Yes, absolutely! While Image Recognition of the sun DOES work, I could easily only use photoresisters or many of the
other ways very smart people have figured out how to make a Sun tracker. These ways would not help me learn Python or
image recognition which is my real goal with this part of the project. So, yes I concede I am wasting energy by going 
this route but like Frank Sinatra said "I did it my way!"

Q. What's the ultimate goal here?
A. What I want to achaive by the end of all of this is to have a solar-powered RaspberryPi 10 node cluster being able to
run BOINC or another type of folding application for science. I could use it to mine whatever coin but I would prefer
to keep my endevours scientific. Basically, I just want to learn and figure this out on my own.
